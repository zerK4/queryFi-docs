### `where` Method Documentation

The `where` method is used to dynamically build query conditions for the backend. This method supports both simple key-value pairs and more complex conditions involving operators such as `>`, `<`, `=`, `like`, `in`, `between`, etc.

<Note type="note" title="Note">
  **After finishing building your query attach `.build()`, `.get()` or `.first()` to generate it.**
</Note>

## Method Signature

```typescript
where(
  conditions:
    | { [K in keyof T]?: T[K] }
    | Array<[keyof T, AllowedOperators, any]>
): this;
```

### Parameters

- `conditions`: 
  - A key-value pair object where each key represents a column and the value represents the condition to apply.
  - Or, an array of conditions where each condition is an array with the format `[column, operator, value]`.

### Supported Operators

The second element of the condition array (the operator) can be one of the following values:

- `"="`: Equal to.
- `">"`: Greater than.
- `"<"`: Less than.
- `">="`: Greater than or equal to.
- `"<="`: Less than or equal to.
- `"!="`: Not equal to.
- `"like"`: Pattern matching with `LIKE`.
- `"not like"`: Exclude matches with `NOT LIKE`.
- `"whereIn"`: Check if a column’s value is in a set of values.
- `"whereNotIn"`: Check if a column’s value is not in a set of values.
- `"whereBetween"`: Check if a column’s value is between two values.
- `"whereNotBetween"`: Check if a column’s value is not between two values.

### Return Type

The method returns the current instance (`this`), allowing method chaining.

### Usage Examples

#### 1. Basic Key-Value Pair (Equality)

Condition where a column is equal to a specific value.

```typescript
.where([["id", "=", 10]])

//or

.where({
    id: 10
})
```
Generates the query:  
```bash
where[id]=10
```

#### 2. Greater Than (`>`)

Condition where a column’s value is greater than the specified value.

```typescript
.where([["age", ">", 30]])
```
Generates the query:  
```bash
where[age]>30
```

#### 3. Less Than (`<`)

Condition where a column’s value is less than the specified value.

```typescript
.where([["age", "<", 30]])
```
Generates the query:  
```bash
where[age]<30
```

#### 4. Greater Than or Equal (`>=`)

Condition where a column’s value is greater than or equal to the specified value.

```typescript
.where([["age", ">=", 30]])
```
Generates the query:  
```bash
where[age]>=30
```

#### 5. Less Than or Equal (`<=`)

Condition where a column’s value is less than or equal to the specified value.

```typescript
.where([["age", "<=", 30]])
```
Generates the query:  
```bash
where[age]<=30
```

#### 6. Not Equal (`!=`)

Condition where a column’s value is not equal to the specified value.

```typescript
.where([["age", "!=", 30]])
```
Generates the query:  
```bash
where[age]!==30
```

#### 7. Like (`like`)

Condition where a column’s value matches a pattern using `LIKE`.

```typescript
.where([["name", "like", "%john%"]])
```
Generates the query:  
```bash
where[name][like]=%john%
```

#### 8. Not Like (`not like`)

Condition where a column’s value does not match a pattern using `NOT LIKE`.

```typescript
.where([["name", "not like", "%admin%"]])
```
Generates the query:  
```bash
where[name][not+like]=%admin%
```

#### 9. Where In (`whereIn`)

Condition where a column’s value is in a list of values.

```typescript
.where([["id", "whereIn", [10, 20, 30]]])
```
Generates the query:  
```bash
where[id][whereIn][]=10&where[id][whereIn][]=20&where[id][whereIn][]=30
```

#### 10. Where Not In (`whereNotIn`)

Condition where a column’s value is not in a list of values.

```typescript
.where([["id", "whereNotIn", [10, 20, 30]]])
```
Generates the query:  
```bash
where[id][whereNotIn][]=10&where[id][whereNotIn][]=20&where[id][whereNotIn][]=30
```

#### 11. Where Between (`whereBetween`)

Condition where a column’s value is between two values.

```typescript
.where([["id", "whereBetween", [10, 20]]])
```
Generates the query:  
```bash
where[id][whereBetween][]=10&where[id][whereBetween][]=20
```

#### 12. Where Not Between (`whereNotBetween`)

Condition where a column’s value is not between two values.

```typescript
.where([["id", "whereNotBetween", [10, 20]]])
```
Generates the query:  
```bash
where[id][whereNotBetween][]=10&where[id][whereNotBetween][]=20
```

#### 13. Multiple conditions

```typescript
.where([
    ['id', 'in', [10, 50, 100, 20, 30]],
    ['name', '%like%', "%john%"],
    ['status', '=', "active"],
]).build()
```
